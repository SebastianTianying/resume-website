Hey there! I am Tianying (Seb) Zhu, a first-year master student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) üíô. Before, I graduated from the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) üß° with a Bachelor of Science degree in [Computer Science and Economics](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-x-degree-programs/computer-science-economics). I have just finished interning at [BreezeML](https://breezeml.ai), a VC-backed ML infrastructure company, as a Software Engineer Intern.  I have also interned at [CreateLab](https://createlab.cs.illinois.edu) as a research assistant. 

Outside of work, I am also a snowboarder üèÇ (hopefully getting an AASI level 1 certification soon!), travel blogger üèîÔ∏è and car enthusiast üèéÔ∏è (street cars and F1 racing). I used to write blog posts and hotel reviews for a travel blog with over 30k followers.
